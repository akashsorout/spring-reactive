# spring-reactive
Just for learning reactive with spring boot  

**Spring WebFlux** provides two way of programming model  

- **Annotated Controller:** `@RestController` `@RequestMapping` and some other annotations to handle endpoints
- **Functional Endpoints:** An another programming model having `HandlerFunction` and `RouterFunction`


Both the programming model run on same `reactive-core` foundation

We are using cassandra as NoSql database here.

`spring-data-cassandra` is used to interact with database.
`spring-boot-starter-data-cassandra` dependency is used to achieve this.
